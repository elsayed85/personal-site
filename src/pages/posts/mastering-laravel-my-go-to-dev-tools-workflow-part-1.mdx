As a senior Laravel developer, I’ve learned that having the right set of tools and an efficient workflow can make all the difference in productivity and code quality. In this Medium post, I’ll share my personal collection of development tools and extensions, along with my workflow for developing Laravel projects. From basic to advanced, these tools have helped me optimize my work and ensure that I’m making the most of my time as a developer.

 1. VSCode — The Foundation:

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) has become my go-to code editor for its ease of use and wide range of features. VSCode offers excellent support for Laravel development, thanks to the array of extensions available within the marketplace.

Essential VSCode Extensions for Laravel Development:

a. PHP IntelliSense: This extension provides intelligent code completion, helping to improve the overall efficiency while writing PHP code by providing accurate suggestions as you type.

b. PHP Intelephense: Intelephense is a fast and feature-rich PHP language server, which offers advanced auto-complete, function signatures, and semantic analysis — all of which play a significant role in enhancing productivity.

c. Laravel Extension Pack: This is a collection of various essential extensions for Laravel development. It includes syntax highlighting, snippets, Eloquent model factories, and much more.

d. Laravel Pack: Another useful Laravel extension pack, it comprises extensions like Blade snippets, Laravel Artisan, and Route IntelliSense, making it easier to work with Laravel.

e. Laravel Goto Config: This extension allows you to quickly navigate to Laravel’s config files, ensuring easy access to essential settings and reducing the time spent searching.

f. Laravel Goto Controller: With this extension, jumping to the desired controller from routes or views becomes a breeze. It simplifies navigation and speeds up the coding process.

g. Laravel Goto Env: Managing environment variables is crucial, and this extension allows you to quickly access and edit your .env file from anywhere within your project.

h. Laravel Goto View: This helpful tool allows you to navigate directly to a view file from your controller — streamlining your workflow and minimizing the time spent searching for files.

2. Git and Composer — Essential Tools for Modern Developers:

a. Git: Version control is vital when working on any development project, and Git has become the industry standard. Git allows me to track changes in my code, work collaboratively with other developers, and maintain a well-organized codebase. By integrating Git with VSCode, I can seamlessly commit changes, merge branches, and navigate through my code’s history.

b. Composer: As Laravel’s primary dependency manager, Composer plays an essential role in building and maintaining my projects. Composer not only manages the installation and updating of Laravel packages but also simplifies their integration with autoloaders. It helps to standardize the structure of PHP applications and streamline the inclusion of external libraries.

c. Git Aliases and Artisan Commands: To make the most out of Git, I’ve created a set of aliases that help me quickly access frequently used commands and avoid memorizing or typing lengthy command lines. These aliases enable me to perform operations like pulling, pushing, and merging with ease. Here’s an example of my Git aliases:

``` bash ./bashrc
alias pa='php artisan'
alias pas='php artisan serve'
alias ray='composer require spatie/laravel-ray'
alias rayd='composer require spatie/laravel-ray --dev'
alias routes='php artisan route:list'
alias query='composer require mouadziani/laravel-query-inspector'

alias pam='php artisan migrate'
alias pamr='php artisan migrate:reset'
alias pamf='php artisan migrate:fresh'

alias res='php artisan make:resource'

alias wire='php artisan make:livewire'

alias work='php artisan queue:work'
alias ws='php artisan  websockets:serve'

alias pamm='php artisan make:migration'
alias pamc='php artisan make:controller'
alias pams='php artisan make:seeder'
alias seeder='php artisan make:seeder'

alias pamr='php artisan make:request'
alias request='php artisan make:request'

alias event='php artisan make:event'

alias pamnoti='php artisan make:notification'
alias pamn='php artisan make:notification'
alias noti='php artisan make:notification'

alias model='php artisan make:model'
alias policy='php artisan make:policy'

alias middleware='php artisan make:middleware'
alias mid='php artisan make:middleware'
alias mtest='php artisan pest:test'

alias seed='php artisan db:seed'

alias ccache='php artisan cache:clear'
alias cview='php artisan view:clear'
alias croute='php artisan route:clear'
alias cconfig='php artisan config:clear'

alias wip='git add . && git commit -m “wip” && git push origin master'
alias gst='git status'
alias commit='git add . & git commit -m'

alias npmi='npm install'
alias npmw='npm run watch'
alias npmd='npm run dev'
alias npmp='npm run prod'

alias crq='composer require'
alias crv='composer remove'
alias crd='composer dumpautoload'


alias winpwd='cygpath -aw .'
alias clearlog='rm $(winpwd)/storage/logs/laravel.log'
alias clearlogs='find $(winpwd)/storage/logs -name '*.log' -delete'
```

In addition to Git aliases, I also enjoy using Laravel’s Artisan commands, which provide a powerful command-line interface for common tasks such as migrations, generating controllers, or running tests. To speed up my workflow even further, I have created shortcuts for commonly used Artisan commands, enabling me to execute tasks such as generating new migrations or running tests with minimal typing.

3. Debugging Made Easy with [Ray](https://github.com/spatie/ray):

a. [Ray](https://github.com/spatie/ray): Debugging is an integral part of any development process, and having the right tool makes all the difference.
